# Accounting System

This is the **Accounting System** project, built with Node.js and MongoDB. This system helps manage financial records, transactions, and user accounts efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naimurk/xponent-accouting-system-2.git
   cd accounting-system
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://xponent:xponent123@cluster0.50l1tkw.mongodb.net/accounting_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
   NODE_ENV="development"
   ```
```

Let me know if you'd like me to generate a `.env` file too or want it formatted for a specific framework like Express, Next.js, or NestJS.
